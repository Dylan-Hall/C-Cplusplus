# This is my GitHub Page containing the link to, and descriptions for my portfolio.
  - This branch is specific for C and C++ projects, assignments and programs.
  - This is purely non-distrubtable, their is no licenesed software or distributable code within.
  - Solely used to display and maintain my portofolio.

### - Description -
  
  I)      Assignments: 
              Compilation of past assignments, anywhere between 2015-2017. Mostly used to show the increase in efficency and skill level and the steady changes in my style.
  
  II)     Data Structures:
              An assortment of common and practical data structures, along with their methods. I've written the code for all of these many times. But, it's been a year or two for some so I'm re-writting them with new knowledge and my improved use of coding convention. Also, this will allow me to keep them neat and orderly in the same place, aswell as quick look up for later usage.
              
  III)    Encryption and Decryption:
              A simple set of programs that will encrpt and decrypt strings and numbers. I learned this from a course called Programming for Engineers, it was  a very simple approach and nothing too special. (Possibly up for removal, due to consideration of non-importance.)
        
  IV)     Image Processing:
              This is the source, headers and library files along with the data sets used to process images. This project was written in my second programming class in late 2015 called, Program and Algorithm Design. This program takes in a set of images, and calculates their vertical/horizontal edges, and performs a convex and correlation on them. Then, goes to dynamically create new image names for the related opperation. It also computes a dynamic change in pixel and movement flags and adds them to a document.
              
  V)      Searching:
              An assortment of common searching algorithms, as it is, just linear and binary searching.
              
  VI)     Sorting:
              An assortment of common sorting algorithms, along with their Run time complexity.
