Using ARRAY manipulation
Program1 : basic encryption
Program1b: more advanced version of program1
Program1c: more advanced version of program1b, my attempt at salting didn't work.. YET

Using variables (like you asked for origionally)
program1_variables


I'm going to perfect my origional code using arrays. Just didn't have the time with other classes right now, and I just wanted to go ahead and complete the assignment
the way you origionally asked for, using variable manipulation.

But, I also wanted to show you my approach using Arrays, I just didn't have time to go in and use concatenation to connect salted letters and numbers to the end of each
index in my arrays.

Like I said, I will get to that eventually just for future use and personal knowledge and acheivment of it!
